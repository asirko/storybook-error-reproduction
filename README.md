# Reproduction of an error

```
npm i
npm run storybook
```

When storybook open go to [the MDX version of the documentation](http://localhost:6010/?path=/docs/mycompo-mdx--with-template-app-my-compo-app-my-compo-synthax) 
The first stories in the page should work perfectly. But the last should throw errors in the console, those errors are also documented in the MDX file.
